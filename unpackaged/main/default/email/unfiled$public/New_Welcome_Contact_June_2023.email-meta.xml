    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}:

Welcome to ECCHO! We are pleased that you have chosen to join the approximately 2,500 ECCHO members who use the ECCHO Rules to govern their image exchange and gain information and support for check payments processing. Please feel free to circulate this letter throughout your check operations to communicate the ECCHO benefits which are now available to your organization.

Our Strategic Priorities

ECCHO provides:

ECCHO Rules for private sector electronic check exchanges
Advocacy for the check industry including helping members understand proposed regulatory changes and providing comments on proposals for regulatory amendments
Check Education on All Things Check, What Do I Do When? and a library of check related education and resources, and National Check Certification (NCP) program is a nationally recognized accreditation for check professionals who successfully pass the exam enabling them to have proven knowledge on check rules &amp; regulations, check operations, check products, fraud and risk mitigation.

Special ECCHO-Only Rules:

Rule 9 warranty for forged/counterfeit items – subject to conditions &amp; ability to opt out
Rule 8 – ability to use return system to process unauthorized RCC warranty claims
Ability to send electronic checks with as-read/partial MICR by agreement
ECCHO only adjustments:

Return adjustment
Wrong Payee Credit – Depositary bank seeks to pass credit to maker’s account at Paying bank. Example: wrong check enclosed/lockbox posts telephone check payment to entity other than telephone company payee and subsequently identifies the processing error.
